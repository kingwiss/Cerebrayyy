### 2. Run Performance Tests
```bash
# Run full performance test suite
npm run performance-test

# Run with custom options
npm run performance-test -- --url http://localhost:3000 --iterations 5 --output ./reports
```

### 3. Analyze Bundle Size
```bash
# Analyze JavaScript bundle size
npm run bundle-analyzer
```

## üìä Performance Thresholds

### Good Performance Targets
- **FPS**: ‚â• 55 (target 60)
- **Memory Usage**: < 100 MB
- **Render Time**: < 16ms per frame
- **Touch Latency**: < 50ms
- **LCP**: < 2.5s
- **FID**: < 100ms
- **CLS**: < 0.1

### Alert Conditions
The monitoring system will alert when:
- FPS drops below 55
- Memory usage exceeds 100 MB
- Render time exceeds 16ms
- Touch latency exceeds 50ms
- Web Vitals fall into "Poor" category

## üîß Configuration

### Performance Monitor Settings
```javascript
// Customize thresholds
window.performanceMonitor.thresholds = {
    minFPS: 55,
    maxMemory: 100, // MB
    maxRenderTime: 16, // ms
    maxTouchLatency: 50, // ms
    maxDOMQueries: 100 // per second
};
```

### Performance Optimizer Settings
```javascript
// Enable/disable specific optimizations
window.performanceOptimizer.enableOptimization('imageOptimization');
window.performanceOptimizer.disableOptimization('lazyLoading');

// Check current status
console.log(window.performanceOptimizer.getOptimizationStatus());
```

## üìà Understanding Reports

## üéØ Optimization Recommendations

### Based on Common Issues

#### Low FPS / Jittery Animations
- Use `transform` instead of changing `left/top` properties
- Enable hardware acceleration with `transform3d(0,0,0)`
- Reduce animation complexity during low performance
- Use `will-change` property sparingly

#### High Memory Usage
- Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Remove event listeners when elements are removed from DOM
- Clear intervals and timeouts when no longer needed
- Use `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` for temporary references

#### Slow Loading
- Optimize images (WebP format, proper sizing)
- Enable compression (gzip/brotli)
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement critical resource preloading

#### Poor Touch Responsiveness
- Use `passive: true` for touch event listeners
- Implement touch event throttling
- Avoid heavy computations in touch handlers
- Use CSS `touch-action` property appropriately

## üîç Debugging Performance Issues

4. Use the overall score to track improvements

### Running Performance Tests
1. Ensure your app is running locally
2. Run `npm run performance-test`
3. Review the generated HTML report
4. Implement suggested optimizations
5. Re-run tests to measure improvements

## üö® Common Performance Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Practices
- Frequent DOM queries in loops
- Synchronous operations in event handlers
- Large images without optimization
- Excessive event listeners
- Memory leaks from uncleaned references
- Blocking the main thread with heavy computations

### Best Practices
- Cache DOM queries
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for animations
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical content
- Use Web Workers for heavy computations
- Optimize images and use appropriate formats
- Monitor and clean up memory usage

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Performance Monitor Not Showing
- Ensure you're in development mode (localhost)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page

#### High Memory Alerts
- Check for memory leaks in your code

## üîÑ Continuous Monitoring

### Setting Up Automated Testing
1. Integrate performance tests into your CI/CD pipeline
2. Set performance budgets and fail builds on regressions
3. Monitor Web Vitals in production using analytics
4. Set up alerts for performance degradation

### Production Monitoring
- Use Real User Monitoring (RUM) tools
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
- Set up performance alerts in your monitoring system
- Regularly review performance reports and optimize accordingly
