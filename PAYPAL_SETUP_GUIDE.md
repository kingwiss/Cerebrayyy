- Ensure server is running on correct port

**Payment Fails:**
- Verify Plan ID matches your PayPal subscription plan
- Check that business account is verified
- Ensure subscription plan is active

**Premium Not Activated:**
- Check server logs for API errors
- Verify `/api/paypal-subscription-success` endpoint is working
- Check `users.json` file for user data

### Debug Tools:

## üö® Security Notes

1. **Never commit live credentials** to version control

3. **Validate all payments server-side** - Don't trust client-side data
4. **Monitor transactions** regularly in PayPal dashboard

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check PayPal Developer Documentation
2. Review server logs for specific error messages
3. Test with PayPal's sandbox first if needed
4. Contact PayPal Developer Support for payment-specific issues
